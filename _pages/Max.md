## Core Principles

1. Max must be capable of running on locally deployed hardware with all context data and collected data kept locally.
- This is the best way to keep the user's best interests in mind
- Secure cloud deployments may be acceptable in some cases, but it must not be dependent on any entity.
- A working assumption is using current consumer GPUs will be a viable stand-in for the expected availability of more compact HW solutions
2. Max will require a family member, or other trusted support person to configure and manage the deployed solution.
- This role's main task is to load in relevant context data - daily schedule, personal contacts, family tree, etc., so Max can digest it.
- Remote access is required, and must be secure.
- Passkeys stored locally should help with managing access to various services (streaming, msging, video calling etc.)
- Summaries of Max's interactions and Audit capabilities should be included and made available.
3. Max must restrict interaction to the provided context, and not expose a general chatbot experience.
