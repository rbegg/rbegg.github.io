I'm an experienced software development leader currently diving back into hands-on development,
driven by a personal mission.

My mission is to create 'Max'—a viable, locally-hosted AI assistant—to help seniors who feel left behind by technology.
I've witnessed how quality of life suffers when technology becomes a barrier, preventing them from:
- Operating a smart TV
- Messaging, calling or video-chatting with family and friends
- Managing appointments or navigating their environment

This site, Augmented Development, documents my journey along three key paths:
1. Delivering Max: An ethical, privacy-first AI assistant to help maximize a user's quality of life.
2. A Pragmatic Journey: Exploring how AI can augment a developer's skills and abilities, from bootstrapping to mastery.
3. Modern Leadership: Gaining fresh, hands-on experience to lead technical teams with current, practical insight.

My goal is to share this journey openly. 
If you're a developer exploring AI, a leader building new teams, or just curious about 'Max', 
I hope you find these posts valuable. 
Please follow the topics that matter to you, and I look forward to the conversation.
